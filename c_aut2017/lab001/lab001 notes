Problem requirement: convert volume of ounces to millilitres

Analyse:

  They're going to have to input a number, possibly with a decimal place
  scanf of a variable capable of holding decimal places.
    Q: What variable should I use?

  What if they input a letter? -> Use isdigit function to check if it's
  a number
    Q: What are the value outputs for a isdigit function?
    Q: How will I implement with an if-else function?

  I have to take input, multiply it by the conversion factor then save the
  variable
  Then have to output the number

Implement the algorithm:

Pseudocode implementation:
  Declare variables -> input and output

  printf("Please enter a volume in ounces:\n")

  scanf("%", &variable)

  isdigit(input)
    if(isdigit = it's a number)
      then: input * conversion factor = output, & printf("output")

    else (printf("yo wtf that's not a number"))

    return 0;
