GPA must be 0 >= x <= 4.0
GPA displays four decimal places and rounds up at the fifth
The displayed value determines what is too big or too small

The list has two \n escape sequences before it, every time it prints.


Dates:
days <= 31
month <=12
Year must be >= 1800 and <=2017

Displaying the results you have to make sure there's no space

'Invalid day' prints on a separate line but then prompts for new information
on the same line.
E.g.
"Enter day>32
Invalid day. Enter day>"

Don't enter decimal places into the database under day, month or year.
It will eternally loop.
