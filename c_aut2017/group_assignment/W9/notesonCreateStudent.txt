You want to take in the head of the list and add to the end of it.
So they give you the root/head of the list, and you then go to the end of it,
then once you're there, set the values and create a new struct, set the new
structs nextp to NULL and return back to main.

1. Go to end of list, using ip.
2. Set the value once ip is equal to the last node in the list.
3. create a new struct
4. set it's ip->next == NULL
5. exit

No point in setting ip equal to the last node, because that information will
be lost when we return to the main... right?
